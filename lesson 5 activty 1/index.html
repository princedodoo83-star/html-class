        <h2>A SIMPLE WEBPAGE ON DOGS</h2>
                 <p><strong><i>Dogs are clever, smart and playful animals with ken scent of smell. Dogs are domestic mammal of the
                 family Carnivoras. It is a subspecies of the gray wolf and is related to foxes and jackals. The dog
                 is one of the two most ubiquitous and most popular domestic animals in the world (the cat is the
                 other). For more than 12,000 years it has lived with humans as a hunting companions, protectors,
                 object of scorn or adoration, and friend.Dogs are regarded differently in different parts of the world. Dogs exhibit characteristics like<mark> loyalty, friendship, protectiveness and playfulness</mark>. These qualities
                 and affection have earned dogs an important position in Western society, and in the United States and Europe the care
                 and feeding of dogs has become a multibillion-dollar business. Western civilization has given the relationship between
                 human and dog great importance, but, in some of the developing nations and in many areas of Asia, dogs are not held in
                 the same esteem. In some areas of the world, dogs are used as guards or beasts of burden or even for food, whereas in
                 the United States and Europe dogs are protected and admired. In ancient Egypt during the days of the pharaohs, dogs were
                 considered to be sacred.</i></strong></p><br><br>

                 The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.
                 It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work,
                 including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work, and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog,
                 and according to the Fédération Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in
                 2013. The German Shepherd is the second-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club,and also the best friend of Police and and other forces.</strong></p><br><br>
